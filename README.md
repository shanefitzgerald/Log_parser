### __important!__

The node project is using native imports.  Because of this, you must use node __Node.js >= v13__.

If you have node version manager installed run:
```bash
nvm use
```
in the root of the project and it will default to __Node v15.3.0__.

### To Start the app

from the root of the project directory run:
```bash
yarn
```
to install packages. Once that is done to start the app run:
```bash
yarn dev
```
If you would like to open the node js debug port run:
```bash
yarn dev:debug
```

### To Run Tests
To run the tests run:
```bash
yarn test
```
